Absolute Beginners Guide CI/CD:
-------------------------------

1. CI - Continuous Integration - 95% Tester are using only CI
2. CD - Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment.

For a Change this time its a Wague Theory:
------------------------------------------
Continuous Integration is the practice of running your test on a non_developer machine automatically every time someone Pushes new code in source Repository.
 
In OtherWords, Whenever we add some new code and commit it the Repository, we have to ensure that the new one Shouldn't break the existing working code.
So its mandatory to run automated tests for every new commit. this kind of Continuous integration testing process is called CI.

CD - Delivery. it is like a Preparation Process.
the process of making the code to be deployable.

CD - deployment. it is the actual process of deployment.

Our focus should be on CI. 
 
Tool we are going to use Jenkins.

Some CI/CD Tools are --> Bamboo CI, Travis CI, hudson, Circle CI.
